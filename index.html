			<h1>Coding</h1>
			<p>Hurray! Coding is my latest skills I have aquired from ispace. As a potential web developer I can now use html and css to design my web page just the way I want it. No more stories from the "IT guys". I can commit and comment, use developer tools as I like and above all push to github. You do not Understand right? Don't worry join ispace then you will. </p>

			<h1>Beading</h1>
			<p>Beads add color to our life. I like beading and will mostly spend my leisure time beading. I bead tissue covers, bags, key holders among others. You can always request for your beaded products through my web page which is still in progress.</p>

	<h1>Marketing</h1>
	<p>I have a fair knowledge in Maketing from the university coupled with my own marketing abilities, am able to brand and market my bead products. As it is consumers know not what they want. So all I need to do is to show them my bead products in a convincing way and they will buy.</p>
</div>
	<div class="code">
	<h1>Writing</h1>
	<p>I also like writing at my leisure time. When I feel like doing nothing I just grab my pen and paper and start writing whatever that comes to mind. As an aspiring novelist am improving my writing skills by trying to pen down something when am free.</p>
